# Contents 

The main parts of the repository is divided into supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning folders and the the misc_folder consists of supporting files. The ``` misc_folder ``` contains the following files:
  * A Deep neural network architecture drawing file.
  * Epidemiological models to study the `n=2` strain in a given population implemented in Python. The aim is to analyze the effect of `n=2` disease strains consisting of different variations. The problem solves the case for `n=2` disease strains affecting a given population, which was submitted in partial fulfillment of the award of the Postgraduate Diploma at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Capetown, South Africa.
  * A python program implemented to study the simulation of a molecule in the nucleus of an atom.

## Learning repository

- We distinguish three different learning repositories: the supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning repositories. In each case, we present recent code examples and explanations on how to apply different Machine Learning algorithms to solve several problems.
