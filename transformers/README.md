# Main Concepts

-----------------------------------------------
## Tools used in training Transformers
- Python 3.10+
- Observation via Grafana (UI), Loki(logs), tempo(traces) and Prometheus (metrics).
- Pytorch (for some examples)
- Examples implemented using mlflow for monitoring and used in training pipelines.
- TensorFlow - a library from training machine learning models
- Flax is a  flexible user experience library via JAX 
## Models Implemented
The following models are implemented in this folder:

- Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)
