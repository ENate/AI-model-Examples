## Introduction
A guide to learn the basis of supervised learning methods with examples and tools. We begin with basic definition and present examples on many topics.

### Definition
To define supervised learning, we need to revisit basic statistics, regression and classification. Before that, we identify two parts of any given data: inputs and outputs. For example, imagine having measurements about the weather in the past 1 week. If the goal is to predict the weather in the coming days, we may construct our problem based on that.
