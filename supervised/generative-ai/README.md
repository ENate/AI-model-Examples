### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS)

### Introduction
The examples presented in this forlder represent generative models -- which are  deep learning methods based on a generator feed forward neural network and a distributor. Formulated on ideas linked to game theory, it is meant to present to competing networks which will output a given probability using information derived from the data set.

### Features of GANs
- Two competing agents whose objectives is to work for opossing goals.
- This implies each participating agent continues to come up with strategies to decieve one another
- This method is associated with Game theoretic minimax methods.

In order to understand the foundation, implementation and application of GANs, we provide a basic desciption of the model. Then provide concrete examples on how GANs can be applied to a real life problem. Before delving into these steps, we will like to describe a simple example of a typical scenario which can be used to replicate GANs models.

### Example Description
Consider a situation involving two agents in real life: a police officer and a criminal. As stated in the example here, if the criminal is a counterfeiter, and often tries to come up with ways to evade detection, the police officer will also come up with a much better way to provide security.
