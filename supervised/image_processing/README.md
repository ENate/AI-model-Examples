# Reinforcement Learning Basics

--------------------------
This folder contains reinforcement learning examples for a number of given problems. We also discuss the concepts, definition of terms and highlight the 
differences between RL and supervised learning approaches. First, we identify the terms and `actors`, which are associated with RL. Then, discuss common algorithms and present few examples.
Also included are tools, references and recent advancements in RL.

## Definition and Concepts

--------------------------

- An example of a ML implementation using docker
  * Convolutional deep neural network architecture drawing file.
  * Applying many of the modern tools to train models and show their strengths and limitations.
  * Show implementations in both development and production environments using publicly available data sets.
